# Vendor Performance Analysis – Data Analytics Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes vendor performance data to identify inefficiencies and provide actionable business insights. The workflow simulates a real-world **Business Analyst** project using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and prepare vendor data using **SQL**.  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **hypothesis testing** using Python.  
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as delivery time, defect rate, cost efficiency, sales contribution, and profit margin.  
- Build an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for business stakeholders.  
- Generate a summary report with recommendations for vendor selection and cost optimization.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **SQL** → Data cleaning and querying  
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, NumPy) → EDA and hypothesis testing  
- **Power BI** → Dashboard and visualization  
- **Excel/CSV** → Input dataset  

## 📊 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning (SQL)** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)** – Trend analysis, vendor comparison, and visualizations.  
3. **Statistical Analysis** – Hypothesis testing & confidence intervals to validate assumptions.  
4. **Dashboard (Power BI)** – KPIs for sales, gross profit, margin, vendor/brand performance.  
5. **Report Writing** – Insights and actionable recommendations.  

## Database
